# 👋 Wave-Extension

Wave is a Firefox/Chrome compatible alternative to the [Nod extension for Google meet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nod-reactions-for-google/oikgofeboedgfkaacpfepbfmgdalabej), which is currently Chrome-only. It sends the emoji as chat messages so other people in the meet don't need to have the extension installed to see them.
